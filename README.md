VS_SQL_TextSchemeMigrator
=========================

GUI application that lets you copy over your text editor's
settings (colors, fonts, styles) from Visual Studio to
SQL Server Management Studio. The core code was based off
the awesome work of Mr. Tomas Restrepo https://github.com/tomasr/VSColorsToSQL

You can also use this tool to copy over settings from different
versions of SQL Server Management Studio/Business Intelligence Studio.

So far it supports Visual Studio 2005 and 2008, SQL Server Management
Studio 2005 and 2008. Support for Visual Studio 2010 and some of the
Express SKUs will come as soon as I stop procrastinating about it.
